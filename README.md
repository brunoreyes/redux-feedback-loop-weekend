# Feedback Loop

## Project Description

I was tasked with creating a Feedback Loop that:

- Let's user's enter information in a multi-part form.
- Create a 'Next' & 'Previous' button to allow user to navigate forward & backwards.
- Has an option to review feedback and if changes need to be made, users can update their info.
- When feedback has been submitted, send & store the submission in a database.
- Implement Material UI for buttons & input fields.
- Pauses & guides a user's flow to fill out portions of the form that are incomplete.

### Duration: 10 Hours
